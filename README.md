  - The employee tracker was made to make managers track and control their employees.

  - The tracker uses two NPM packages (mysql2 and inquirer).

  - Inquirer is used to prompt the user with questions.

  - MYSQL2 is used as a connection to a database.

## Installation

  - Install all required NPM packages

## Usage

  - Once the user has installed the NPM packages, go into mysql and login, then connect to all the databases.

  - Next, exit mysql and node index.js, this will initialize the prompt and will allow you to then view all your database and allows you to edit the database or add to it.

  - Once finished, just click exit.
